I'm thrilled to share that <br>
I've just completed a new project: a fully functional timer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!  <br>
⏲️ This project was a fantastic learning experience, helping me sharpen my skills in front-end development.

Key Features:  <br>
=> Start, Stop, and Reset functionality  <br>
=> Clean and simple user interface  <br>

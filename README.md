I'm thrilled to share that I've just completed a new project: a fully functional timer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! ⏲️ This project was a fantastic learning experience, helping me sharpen my skills in front-end development.

Key Features:
=> Start, Stop, and Reset functionality
=> Clean and simple user interface
